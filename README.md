### Description
The Pilgrims progress game is a story game where for the player to go to the next level, they have to click on the right answer. For every answer they get right, they get points and move on to the next level. If they get an answer wrong, they lose points and a prompt message pops up to make them click on the right button until they go on to the next level. The purpose of the game is to perservere on the journey until the final destination is reached, which is the Celestial city. Once all levels are completed and the Celestial city has been reached, the player will be awarded with the Crown of life for making the journey.

### How to download 
1. Follow the link and and clone the project: https://mimiumoh.github.io/Sparta-Project-1/. 
2. Then follow the instructions.

### Challenges 
1. My if statments were not wrapped up in a function, that meant if I clicked on any button, it would take me to a certain level. There was no chronological order for my game because I had not programmed it in a way where certain condtions had to be met. 
2. At first, I made multiple HTML pages, but could not make them all work on a single javascript file, which meant I had to rethink my whole game again. I was not too sure how I was going to only use one Javascript and HTML file for the actual game.

### Learning Points
 1. I have learned how to use one HTML file and Javascript file to create multiple levels in  a game. At first I understood the logic of the game, but I just didn't know how to put it into code. But thankfully, my trainers and colleagues helped me to understand it a better, and my friend, who is a programmer, helped me to formulate the format of the code, consolidating my knowledge of functions, function calling and if else statments. My game is very simple and easy to undertsand, and most of the code is made up of if else statements.
