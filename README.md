#Description
The Pilgrims progress game is a storygame where for the player to go to the next level, they have to click on the right answer. For every answer they get right, they get points and move on to the next level. If they get an answer wrong, they lose points and a prompt message pops up to make them clickon the right button till they go on to the next level. The purpose of the game is to perservere on the journey till the final destination is reached, which is the Celestial city. Once all levels are completed and the Celestial city has been reached, the player willbe awarded with the Crown of life for making the journey.

##Challenges 
-My if statments were not wrapped up in a function, that meant if I clicked on any button, it would take me to a certain level. There was no chronological order for my game because i hadnt programmed it in a way where certain condtions had tobe met. 
-At first also, I made multiple HTML pages, but could notmake them all work on a singular javascript file, which meant I had to rethink my whole game again. I was not too sure how I was going to only use one Javascript and HTML file for the actual game.

# Learning Points
 I have learned how to use one HTML file and Javascript file to create multiple levels in  a game. At first I  got the logic of the game, but I just didn't know how to put it into coding. But thankfully, my trainers and colleagues helped me to understand it a better, and one of my Friend's who is a programmer, helped to me formulate the format of the code, consolidating my knowledge of functions , functions calling and if else statments. My game is very simple and easy to undertsand, and most of the code is made up of if else staments--fucntions are called dependng on whether or not a certian condtion is met.
