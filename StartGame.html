    Your name is Christian, you live in a city called the City of Destruction. You have just recently finished reading
    The Good Book, which has given you a way to get rid of your burdens. The book suggests that you flee from the city
    of destruction and make your way to the Celestial City, where you will live forever—and be given the Crown of Life.
    You want your wife and children to come with you, but they seem ever too comfortable in the City of Destruction.
    So, you contemplate whether or not you want to go. If you go, you don’t know the obstacles you may encounter on the
    way. However, if you stay, you have to live with your burdens for the rest of your life. What do you do? Please
    click on the correct answer?
